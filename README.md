Welcome to my blog and audit notes repository, where I share in-depth posts on blockchain security, smart contract auditing, and related technical topics. These articles and notes aim to provide insights, practical tips, and lessons learned from my work in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Blog Posts
In-depth articles on key blockchain security concepts I encounter while auditing smart contracts, alongside analyses of intriguing bugs found in audit reports. Topics include vulnerabilities, gas optimization, and best practices.

## Audit Notes
Technical notes from my audit contest experiences, focusing on methodologies, tools, and general security principles. These are written to be as generic as possible, avoiding contest-specific details to make them accessible to anyone interested in blockchain security.

More posts and notes coming soon!
