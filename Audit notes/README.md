# Audit Notes

This directory contains my technical notes from smart contract audit contests, capturing my approaches and insights from analyzing blockchain protocols. These notes are written to be as generic as possible, focusing on methodologies, tools, and general security principles rather than contest-specific details, making them accessible to anyone interested in blockchain security.
